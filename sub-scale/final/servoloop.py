#Servo BNO stabilization control 
#Written by Anton Voronov (ravenspired) for the UMass Rocket Team
#Code for subscale rocket flight (Testing the successful transmission of data during flight of the rocket.
#Sends a transmission including made up accelerometer data and a timestamp of seconds since launch.
#Currently tested on an Adafruit Feather Huzzah (4MB Flash) running Micropython 1.19.1, connected to a sparkfun XBee Pro 538 Breakout Board.
#This script sends a transmission every second with the amount of seconds since program was run and with made up accelerometer data.

#Pinouts Pico => Stuff

#BNO:
#17 => SDA
#16 => SCL
#3.3V => VIN
#GND => GND

#Servo:
#ext power supply 5v => 5V
#ext power supply GND => GND (Note that this needs to be a common ground with the pico
#19 => PWM in
