#XBEE Serial Communications Demo 11-6-2022
#Written by Anton Voronov (ravenspired) for the UMass Rocket Team
#Demonstration code for subscale rocket flight (Testing the successful transmission of data during flight of the rocket.
#Sends a transmission including made up accelerometer data and a timestamp of seconds since launch.
#Currently tested on an Adafruit Feather Huzzah (4MB Flash) running Micropython 1.19.1, connected to a sparkfun XBee Pro 538 Breakout Board.
#This script sends a transmission every second with the amount of seconds since program was run and with made up accelerometer data.

#WIRING DIAGRAM:
#Feather Board => XBee Pro 538
#3V => 3.3V
#GND => GND
#2 => DIN (SparkFun Board: 4/CPIO)
